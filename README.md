ðŸ“Œ About the Project

TerpPlates is a web application where students can share their dining hall experiences by leaving comments and star ratings. Users can also view reviews from other students, helping them make informed decisions about where to eat.

This project is built using:

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend
Node.js and Express for the backend
MongoDB for storing and retrieving reviews dynamically
Each dining hall has its own dedicated review section, ensuring that 251 North, South Diner, and Yahentamitsi each have separate comments. (Homepage stars are not accurate)
